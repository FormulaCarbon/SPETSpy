# SPETSpy
SProcket Editing ToolS (python version). Original C++ version made by Argore

## Usage

### Recommended: Run .exe
On the github page, go to releases and download the latest `SPETSpy_version.exe`. Double click to run, answer the questions, and let the program do the rest.
If you get the error `Faction Folder not found at...`, there should be another entry asking `Folder Contianing Factions:` Give it the FULL path to the Sprockt\Factions folder. For example, mine is `C:/Users/siddh/OneDrive/Documents/My Games/Sprocket/Factions`

### Run as command line command (python version only):
Clone this repository and navigate to src folder. Run this command:
`py -m SPETS "path\to\obj.obj" compartmentname --asvehicle "faction.vehicle"`

## Todo
 - Implement quads with custom .obj file reader
 - Implement exporting
 - Implement face coloring
